# sonar-project.properties

# --- Required metadata ---
# sonar.projectKey: Unique key for your project in SonarQube. 
#                   It's good practice to use a reverse domain name style or your GitHub repo name.
sonar.projectKey=abayomi2_flask-rest-api-cicd 
# sonar.projectName: Display name of your project in SonarQube
sonar.projectName=Flask REST API CICD Project
# sonar.projectVersion: The version of your project being analyzed. 
#                       This can be set dynamically in Jenkins, but a default is good.
sonar.projectVersion=1.0

# --- Path to source code ---
# sonar.sources: Comma-separated paths to directories containing main source files.
#                For your Flask app, this is the 'application' directory.
sonar.sources=application

# --- Language ---
# sonar.language: Language of the project. For Python, specify 'py'.
sonar.language=py

# --- Encoding of the source code ---
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8

# --- Path to test source files (Optional, but good for coverage reporting later) ---
# sonar.tests=application 
# sonar.test.inclusions=**/test_*.py 
# If you want SonarQube to distinguish between source and test files more clearly.
# For Python, often just including the main source directory is enough for analysis,
# and test execution results/coverage reports are imported separately if configured.
# For now, we'll focus on static analysis of the main code.

# --- Python specific properties (Optional, but can be useful) ---
# sonar.python.version: Specify the Python version used by the project.
#                       This helps SonarQube apply the correct rules.
# sonar.python.version=3.12 
# (Uncomment and set if you want to be specific, otherwise SonarQube tries to autodetect)

# sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths: Path to coverage reports (e.g., coverage.xml).
#                                     We are not setting up coverage reports in this step,
#                                     but this is where you would configure it.

# --- Exclusions (Optional) ---
# sonar.exclusions: Comma-separated list of files/paths to exclude from analysis.
#                   e.g., **/venv/**, **/.venv/**, **/test_*.py if you don't want tests analyzed as source.
sonar.exclusions=**/venv/**, **/.venv/**
